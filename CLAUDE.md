# Important Git Commit Instructions

**NEVER mention Claude, Anthropic, or AI assistance in commit messages**. Write commit messages as if they were written by a human developer. Do not include:
- "Generated with Claude Code"
- "Co-Authored-By: Claude"
- Any reference to AI, LLM, or automated generation
- Any emoji or special formatting that might indicate AI assistance

Write professional, concise commit messages following conventional commit format (fix:, feat:, docs:, etc.) without any AI attribution.

# Using Gemini CLI for Large Codebase Analysis

When analyzing large codebases or multiple files that might exceed context limits, use the Gemini CLI with its massive context window. Use `gemini -p` to leverage Google Gemini's large context capacity.

## File and Directory Inclusion Syntax

Use the `@` syntax to include files and directories in your Gemini prompts. The paths should be relative to WHERE you run the gemini command:

### Examples:

**Single file analysis:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/main.py Explain this file's purpose and structure"
```

**Multiple files:**
```bash
gemini -p "@package.json @src/index.js Analyze the dependencies used in the code"
```

**Entire directory:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ Summarize the architecture of this codebase"
```

**Multiple directories:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @tests/ Analyze test coverage for the source code"
```

**Current directory and subdirectories:**
```bash
gemini -p "@./ Give me an overview of this entire project"
# Or use --all_files flag:
gemini --all_files -p "Analyze the project structure and dependencies"
```

### Implementation Verification Examples

**Check if a feature is implemented:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ Has dark mode been implemented in this codebase? Show me the relevant files and functions"
```

**Verify authentication implementation:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @middleware/ Is JWT authentication implemented? List all auth-related endpoints and middleware"
```

**Check for specific patterns:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ Are there any React hooks that handle WebSocket connections? List them with file paths"
```

**Verify error handling:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Is proper error handling implemented for all API endpoints? Show examples of try-catch blocks"
```

**Check for rate limiting:**
```bash
gemini -p "@backend/ @middleware/ Is rate limiting implemented for the API? Show the implementation details"
```

**Verify caching strategy:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @lib/ @services/ Is Redis caching implemented? List all cache-related functions and their usage"
```

**Check for specific security measures:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/ @api/ Are SQL injection protections implemented? Show how user inputs are sanitized"
```

**Verify test coverage for features:**
```bash
gemini -p "@src/payment/ @tests/ Is the payment processing module fully tested? List all test cases"
```

## When to Use Gemini CLI

Use `gemini -p` when:
- Analyzing entire codebases or large directories
- Comparing multiple large files
- Need to understand project-wide patterns or architecture
- Current context window is insufficient for the task
- Working with files totaling more than 100KB
- Verifying if specific features, patterns, or security measures are implemented
- Checking for the presence of certain coding patterns across the entire codebase

## Important Notes

- Paths in `@` syntax are relative to your current working directory when invoking gemini
- The CLI will include file contents directly in the context
- No need for `--yolo` flag for read-only analysis
- Gemini's context window can handle entire codebases that would overflow Claude's context
- When checking implementations, be specific about what you're looking for to get accurate results
