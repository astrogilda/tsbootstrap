        Check that the constructor has sklearn compatible signature and behaviour.

        Overrides skbase's TestAllObjects.test_constructor to handle Pydantic-specific
        behaviors that are incompatible with skbase's strict sklearn compatibility checks.

        This method provides targeted suppressions for known Pydantic behaviors while
        maintaining the core sklearn compatibility validation:

        1. Suppresses errors related to `**kwargs` (varkw) handling, as Pydantic
        models often use `**data` in their `__init__` which skbase flags.

        2. Suppresses errors if a parameter's default value type is `enum.EnumMeta`
        (e.g., for `DistributionTypes.NORMAL`) or `numpy._ArrayFunctionDispatcher`
        (e.g., for `np.mean`), as these are considered valid in tsbootstrap.

        3. Suppresses errors where `get_params` for `model_params` or `rng`
        returns a default (e.g., `{}` or `Generator()`) while the `__init__`
        signature default was `None`. common mismatch with Pydantic's
        field initialization vs. skbase's expectations.

        4. Uses pytest.xfail for known Pydantic validation mismatches that cannot
        be easily suppressed in the general error handling.

        Parameters
        ----------
        object_class : class
            The class to test constructor compatibility for.

        Raises
        ------
        AssertionError

            handled by the Pydantic-aware suppressions.
